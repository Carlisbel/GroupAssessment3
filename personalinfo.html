    courses, some of which were in school, and have thus gained a reasonably good understanding of computers. I aim to enter a programming related field, with the goal of becoming
    a manager, who has hands-on responsibilities, and I am determined to take the necessary steps to achieve this goal.<br></li>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Group Processes</h3>
<p>In Assessment 2, Our Group did struggle to work together, this has been fueled by the holiday and end thereof. Along with variating time zones, this caused all team members to be to some extent unavailable. This lack of communication has caused disarray in the project, as unfortunately separated decisions and choices conflicted. As circumstances have stabilized, and group members have come closer together, both figuratively and in location, co-operation and communication are both not only possible, but likely. In order to further prevent any loss of cooperation, our team has become determined to spend longer times more effectively in online meetings, working actively together, to make it possible to ensure the perfect and desired outcome that had been imagined.

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Network Security protects your network and data from breaches, intrusions and other threats. Network Security involves access control, virus and antivirus
software, application security, network analytics, types of network-related security (endpoint, web, wireless), firewalls, VPN encryption and more.<br>
IT management is the process of overseeing all matters related to information technology operations and resources within an IT organization.
Effective IT management enables an organization to optimize resources and staffing, improve business processes and communication and enforce best practices.
