      <li> Our group has worked well working through the A5 presentation and working through the IT project, we have shared and implemented ideas
        together, and made changes where neccessary</li><br>
      <li>Something that is an ongoing issue is that its almost immpossible to engadge with any scheduled meetings as our team members are either working 
        or has family commitments and the other person may be unavailable to be present for such meeting</li><br>
      <li>We have ultimately used the MS Teams chat to relay information as it becomes available or updated to the website, and when the other person is 
        available they respond and confirming the changes are suitable </li><br>
      <li>One item we have learned is that we have worked well as a group as each team member has actively taken part of a whole section of work and completed
        this to a high standard</li><br>
    <li> We come up with a plan of attack to start the A5 presentation by making a selling pitch to seek.com.au to include it as part of resume addon part of
      their profile creation section</li>
</ul>

 <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
  One surprising thing I have found while researching through some sections of our IT project is the massive wage potential for experienced Java Developers.
   I have seen some companies offering "eight hundred dollars" per day or a yearly wage of 140,000+. I will be buying some "Java how to books" in the near future.
