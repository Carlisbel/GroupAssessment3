      <li> Sabina has as great work ethic and enjoys to communicate well using MS teams to work through our Team project, something I found that she can improve in is to
        utilize more html tags to display a better formatted data on a website and to double check her work more carefully before embedding it into the html pages. And to
        communicate to her peers what she is doing or about to do before making decisions on her own.</li><br>
      <li>Christoffel has great IT skills I have learnt a few tricks from Christoffel in a very short amount of time, the favicon icon and navigation tools,
        Excellent Team contributor looking forward to getting onto the next Project</li><br>
      <li>Jordan Has did make a contribution to the IT Topic Section, im unable to rate Jordan here as I have not seen enough engadgment through Ms Teams, and he was also
        a patient in hospital for some time before he rejoined us </li><br>
      <li>Carl is a great team leader. He keeps things moving forward and motivates everyone. Solves problems with the html code. One thing he can improve on
        would be planning around the time zone differences between team members. "Sabina has wrote this but unfortunatly I can't remove it from the website".
        Definetly raises more questions</li>

<b>Conflicts, Issues and Resolutions</b><br><br>
Your probably wondering why the fantastic 4 have only 2 members remaining in their group. Basicly one member of the group took it upon her self to delete data from one
of the pages in the project with out consulting with either the Team Leader or any other Team Members. It was only discovered later that suddenly all the pictures were not in center
      alignment and on closer inspection of github that headings and html code were also removed from the main index html file. I made screen shots of this information
      and asked why this has happened and to repair the issue to the picture alignment when I was told simply "she doesn't know what to do or I don't know how".
      As a result of this action taking place right before my return trip to Melbourne I removed the collaboraters in the github so no further damage could be done.<br>
      As a Team leader I took action to prevent any further damage to occur to the IT project. Once I arrrived back into Melbourne I returned the collaboraters to github and set
      everything back to normal ready for the scheduled meeting on Saturday afternoon.
      I was later informed on the evening of the 15th of January that "Sabina Italiano" had created a new group with only two days remaining before the final submission date.
      I was directed by Thomas Bierly to remove sabinas contribution and replace her work with my own and extended my submission date to the 18th January 2022.

   <b>Contributions Made</b><br><br>
   Christoffel's contributions consists of the following creating the landing page and link page buttons. IT topics he completed were Raspberry Pis,
   Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices and Machine Learning. Found out about installing the favicon icon, and the javascript for the IT project which utilises 
   google translate to convert to any language. <br><br>
   
   Carl's contributions consists of Team Leader of the group, organising team meetings, note taking. It topics covered were CyberSecurity and Robotics. Also
   proof reading and editing the website and repairing small errors such as minor typo and code glitches in the html and css areas. Created the Tools and Group
   Reflection pages to tie into the Landing Page. IT work "Interview of an IT professional" was conducted on the 5th of January 2022.<br><br>
   
   Sabina and Jordans work and efforts were removed from this project as they left our group on the afternoon of the 14th January 2022 2 days prior to the final submission date, The possible reason for this is
   editing work on the project and not notifying the Team leader or any other team member so they were "firstly removed from collaborating on github". It was basicly a rule mentioned in the very first meeting as communication is the key
   to a successful team.
