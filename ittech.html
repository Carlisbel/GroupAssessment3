<img src="watiscybersecurity.jpg" alt="What is Cybersecurity" style="width:550px;height:275px;">
<p align="justify">Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attack
  from cyber criminals. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from
  business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.
</p>
 <ul style="text-align:left">
  <li>Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.</li><br>
  <li>Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect.
    Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.</li><br>
  <li>Information security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit. Lockable travel Laptop Bags are becoming more popular.</li><br>
   <li>Operational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the
     procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella. Determining who has or needs access to what in any particular
     IT organisation.</li><br>
  <li>Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations
    or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event.
    Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources. This is a well implemented backup plan can combat
    this scenario.</li><br>
   <li>End-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by
     failing to follow good security protocols and procedures. Teaching users how to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various
     other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.</li><br>
</ul>


<br><img src="securitythreats.jpg" alt="" style="width:550px;height:275px;">

<p align="justify">TYPES OF SECURITY THREATS<br>Cybercrime includes single actors or groups targeting systems for financial gain or to cause disruption.<br>
  Cyber-attack often involves politically motivated information gathering.<br>Cyberterrorism is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause panic or fear. This has
  major consequences in the financial markets around the globe.<br><br>MALWARE<br><br>Malware means malicious software or application. One of the most common cyber threats,
  malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a end user’s computer. Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment or
  legitimate-looking download, malware may be used by cyber-hackers to make money or in politically motivated cyber-criminals.
  </p>

  <ul style="text-align:left">
  <li>Virus: A self-replicating program that attaches itself to clean file and spreads throughout a computer system, infecting files with malicious code to prevent computers
    from viruses a regularly updated virus scanner should run after boot up each time you turn on your computer.</li>
  <li>Trojan type of malware is disguised as legitimate software. Cybercriminals trick users into uploading Trojans onto their computer where they cause damage or collect
    data this happens usually when downloading software from torrent sites and unofficial websites sharing software you should always download the software from a trustworthy
    website.</li>
  <li>Spyware: A program that secretly records what a user does, so that cybercriminals can make use of this information. For example, spyware could capture credit card details,
    passwords typed into a keyboard, or simply recording what is happening on the screen.</li>
    <li>Ransomware: Malware which locks down a user’s files and data, with the threat of erasing it unless a ransom is paid. Therefore having multiple backups of your data is
      very important to fight against these attacks. Restoring to an earlier point of time is usually a way around this and improving the security protocols to prevent it from
      re-occurring</li>
  <li>Adware: Advertising software which can be used to spread malware or alternatively uninvited popups in your browsers.</li>
  <li>Botnets: Networks of malware infected computers which cybercriminals use to perform tasks online without the user’s permission this could happen in a public library.</li>

</ul>

<img src="sqlinjectionattak.jpg" alt="" style="width:550px;height:275px;">

<p align="justify">SQL injection<br><br>An structured language query injection is a type of cyber-attack used to take control of and steal data from a database. Cybercriminals
  exploit vulnerabilities in data-software applications to add in malicious code too a databased by malicious SQL statement. This gives them access to the sensitive information
  contained in the database this information has been used in the past to ask for ransom for return of the information almost like black mail to stop the media from catching
  hold.
</p>

<img src="phishingattack.jpg" alt="" style="width:550px;height:275px;">

<p align="justify">Phishing<br><br>Phishing is when cybercriminals target victims with emails, sms and phone calls that appear to be from a legitimate company asking for
  sensitive information. Phishing attacks are often used to dupe people into handing over credit card data and other personal information this is a very common problem
  where targeted people are vulnerable or elderly and not very IT savy.<br<br>Man-in-the-middle attack<br>Man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber threat where a
  cybercriminal intercepts communication between two or more individuals in order to steal electronic data. For example, on an unsecure WiFi network, an attacker could
  intercept data being passed from the victim’s device and the network router.<br>A denial-of-service attack is where cybercriminals prevent a computer system from fulfilling
  legitimate requests by overwhelming the networks and servers with traffic. This renders the system unusable, preventing an organization from carrying out vital functions.
</p>

<p align="justify">End-user protection<br><br>End-user protection or endpoint security is a crucial aspect of cyber security. After all, it is often an individual (the end-user)
  who accidentally uploads malware or another form of cyber threat to their desktop, laptop or mobile device.
So, how do cyber-security measures protect end users and systems? First, cyber-security relies on cryptographic protocols to encrypt emails, files, and other critical data.
  This not only protects information in transit, but also guards against loss or theft.
In addition, end-user security software scans computers for pieces of malicious code, quarantines this code, and then removes it from the machine. Security programs can even
  detect and remove malicious code hidden in primary boot record and are designed to encrypt or wipe data from computer’s hard drive.
Electronic security protocols also focus on real-time malware detection. Many use heuristic and behavioral analysis to monitor the behavior of a program and its code to
  defend against viruses or Trojans that change their shape with each execution (polymorphic and metamorphic malware). Security programs can confine potentially malicious
  programs to a virtual bubble separate from a user's network to analyze their behavior and learn how to better detect new infections.
Security programs continue to evolve new defenses as cyber-security professionals identify new threats and new ways to combat them. To make the most of end-user security
  software, employees need to be educated about how to use it. Crucially, keeping it running and updating it frequently ensures that it can protect users against the latest cyber threats.

  <p align="justify">RAND Europe examined the current state-of-the-art in cybersecurity. In this context, state-of-the-art refers to a snapshot overview of prominent risks,
    threats or policy issues in the field of cybersecurity, as well as issue areas that are perceived to be overlooked by the NCTV or the scientific community.
    The cybersecurity state-of-the-art review is divided into two phases:<br>
Phase 1 aims to perform an initial scan of the cybersecurity field in order to highlight prominent or underexposed issues that are perceived to warrant further attention from
    the NCTV;<br>
Phase 2 aims to investigate the research questions identified in Phase 1, and will be carried out through a separate study. The study only covers Phase 1 of this process.<br>
The overarching aim of this study is therefore to explore which current cybersecurity topics are relevant to be explored further through additional research in Phase 2.

<h3 style="text-align:center"><b>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</b></h3>
<p align="justify">Every Electrically powered appliance in our lives can be turned either on or off. It is useful to be able to send commands to our appliances,
  telling them exactly what to do, and when to do it. This application can be used in everything from lighting up thousands of specific pixels on your computer
  screen, to telling your coffee machine to turn on when you hit your alarm.
Historically, small gates called transistors would be used to detect when you hit your alarm, then allow electricity to flow through to your coffee machine in
  order to turn it on. In this example, this doesn't seem impractical, but in the case of massive computers, or megapixel scale computer screens, laying each
  transistor individually in order to produce a complex output, for every single program a person could think of, it’s better to turn toward microprocessors.<br>
  <br>
Microprocessors still consist of transistors and other gates, the difference here is that microprocessors allow a person to upload custom code in the form of
  binary. Using this input code, a microcontroller then sends a series of electrical outputs in order to power a device. Our lives are made even easier with
  programs which can take almost english like text, and convert it the needed into binary, to then be used to produce the desired electrical output.
  Microcontrollers, such as the popular ATmega8, can perform exactly this task. These small chips however, are still not very popular for amateur use. These
  chips lack the interface to quickly and painlessly create, upload and properly wire a circuit/program. Adding some simple voltage regulators along with SIL
  connectors, and other electronics, and the world famous arduino is created. The arduino is popular amongst hobbyists, as in a very short period of time, a
  computer can be used to upload the required code, wires appropriately placed, and components or other electronic devices connected, in order to perform a
  potentially complex task from start to finish in only a few minutes. Considering this is done with equipment able to fit in a person’s pocket, and the spare
  change in an average person’s wallet able to fund it, this is unprecedented in history, and truly evident of our great technological developments. Seated at
  the right hand of Arduino is Raspberry Pi.<br>
  <br>
Similar to arduino, being able to take input in the form of code and in the case of certain models of Raspberry Pi, produce a custom electrical output or take
  an electrical input, Raspberry Pi is more similar in function to that of a laptop. While Arduino takes commands in the form of binary code, Raspberry Pi uses
  an operating system, usually a specialized form of linux. This operating system can run programs, and send an output to an HDMI port or even take input
  through a mouse and keyboard.
In the Alarm Clock/Coffee Machine example, one single transistor is needed. The processor chips on these boards however, contain from hundreds of thousands to
  several billion transistors. Over the past few decades, the transistor technology has developed from being bigger than a wallet, to being only a few atoms in
  size.
This can be credited to some incredible minds that have built facilities able to craft objects on the atomic scale, and amateur developers seeking to make the
  technology even better and more versatile.
Every year the logic gates in these chips will continue to get smaller, and as such, every year these pieces of technology will get cheaper and easier to use.
  Given this, it may become typical that the average person is willing to make use of these technological wonders, and make their lives easier and smarter.

  The Great benefit of these products becoming popular amongst the average consumer is automation. If people understand how to use the technology, and have access to it,
  the idea is that the average person sees opportunities where these microcontrollers can be implemented, and both automate their lives or even businesses, and simultaneously
  learn about how robots work, and learn about other industrial purposes of microcontrollers. It would yield the world more time, and potentially money saved if everyone
  started using microcontrollers regularly. It could even prove to the world how much can be replaced by these small computers, thus bringing fuel to the rise of robots.
  If this is the case however, there is a general question about whether these automated machines will decimate the job market.
It is logical to assume that if our lives and businesses become automated, that people working will be made redundant. This however I personally believe to be an unlikely
  event. While it is certain that specific jobs and specific workers may become redundant, the new field of robotics allows for an incredibly broad set of new skills that
  will become in demand. Unlike in the past, graphics designers will be required in order to create a user interface, software developers in order to write code, hardware
  developers in order to improve the technology, new workers will come even to simply assemble and maintain these machines, which would be an extremely critical component.
  This is a small list of the potential jobs created by an increase in the simple usage of microcontrollers. While it may be impossible to know for sure, it can be comforting
  knowing that the opportunities for employees will, in ways, certainly increase.

  In the case of microcontrollers and microprocessors, as the technology improves, both cost, and availability will improve. When this happens, it is likely that the average
  person will make use of them. This would certainly and greatly benefit everyone. First people would learn about programming, which is an excellent skill to have especially
  in the changing job market. People would also learn about electronics and how they communicate with microprocessors. It would also improve creativity amongst people as a
  new branch of opportunities is created. To address the question of how the average person would use these in their life; the possibilities are seriously underestimated.
  Microcontrollers could be used in everything from making their own vacuuming robots, or making coffee once a person’s alarm has been pressed to fully automating their
  business or work.
  Microprocessors such as the Raspberry Pi have its own benefits. These could be used to make facial recognizing door bells, or fully fledged laptops. Another product
  popular on the market is the Makey Makey. This is a proud example of microcontrollers coming into the hands of average people, and these people further developing the
  technology. The Makey Makey is similar to Arduino. The difference comes in the demographic. This is a product made for younger children to learn about programming and
  electronics. The defining characteristics of this product are the simple programming, simple wiring, fun to use along with extreme ease of use. For my future children,
  and recommended for others, this is a product that will leap forward the development of this technology as it exposes them to the wonderful world that is programming,
  microprocessors, and microcontrollers.

<h3 style="text-align:center"><b>Robotics in Information Technology</b></h3>
<p align="justify">Today Robots are used for a vast majority of roles some of these are Robots for Medical and Police Training, Vacuum robots and in Automotive Manufacturing
  Industry. In the Automotive industry Robots are programmed to perform repetitive duties hundreds or thousands of times a day with no difference in quality this makes them
  very efficient saving time and money. This keeps vehicles manufactured at their lowest possible purchase price. It is known that in 2005 90% of all robots could be found
  in vehicle assembly plants around the globe.
Robots are of Mechanical construction and are heavy machinery they require electrical components to control its motors or arms to move, and some level of computer programming
  to instruct it to perform certain movements in a sequence. The 3 major brands I have used previously are ABB Kawasaki and Rockwell Robots.
An industrial robot with six joints closely resembles a human arm, it has the equivalent of a shoulder, an elbow and a wrist. Typically, the shoulder is mounted to a
  stationary base structure rather than to a movable body. This type of robot has six degrees of freedom, meaning it can pivot in six different ways. A human arm is
  of similar design just has weight limitations and gets tired after a few short hours.
The future of Robotics Industry is expected to grow significantly in the near term with expectations that the sector could be worth $260 billion by the year 2030.
  Much of this growth would be in the Professional services sector such as cleaning, delivering and transportation.
</p>
  <img src="abb_robots.jpeg" alt="ABB Robots" style="width:550px;height:275px;">
 <p align="justify">In Automotive Manufacturing Robots have caused redundancies in the past at the Ford Motor Factory in Campbellfield and Geelong. By reducing the amount
   of people required in certain welding areas or high-risk working areas but the positive side to this is that the safety of workers was improved and less incidents
   had occurred after implementing Robotics into the Production Line. Later, factories working with robotics and humans were reportedly 85% more productive than without them.
Dr. Jay Baron, former CEO of the Center for Automotive Research, has said of automotive robots. “Automation is necessary for safety, quality and productivity."
Where machines replace humans as the dominant intelligence on the planet, such a scenario seems unlikely. However, business network PwC predicts that up to 30% of
   jobs could be automated by robots by the mid-2030s this is for concern as this has economic implications.
Workers may need to retrain and upskill to find new work. Activities that require mainly physical and manual skills will decline by approximately 18% by 2030, while
   those requiring basic cognitive skills will decline by approximately 28%. There will be an even greater need for those with expertise in science, technology,
   engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
Taxi Drivers, Truck drivers, Bus Drivers and Couriers may soon be replaced by self-autonomous driving cars in 5 years basically robots driving cars, affecting 20
   million workers worldwide.
 </p>
  <img src="robot_driver.jpg" alt="driving robot" style="width:550px;height:275px;">
<p align="justify">We may also see robots as a more integral part of our daily routine. In our homes, many simple tasks such as cooking, and cleaning may be totally
  automated. Similarly, with robots that can use computer vision and natural language processing, we may see machines that can interact with the world more, such as
  self-driving cars and digital assistants.
Robotics will reshape the future of medicine. Surgical robots can perform extremely precise operations, and with advances in AI, could eventually carry out surgeries
  independently I don’t particularly like this as it will also make robots more efficient at killing us off.
The ability for machines and robots to learn could give them an even more diverse range of applications. Future robots that can adapt to their surroundings, master
  new processes, and alter their behavior would be suited to more complex and dynamic tasks.
Ultimately, robots have the potential to enhance our lives. As well as shouldering the burden of physically demanding or repetitive tasks, they may be able to improve
  healthcare, make transport more efficient, and give us more freedom to pursue creative endeavors.
 </p>
<p align="justify">Modern Robotics of today are “state of the art technology” as they usually consist of PLC control and cross networked to communicate with each other,
  For example a Weld robot arm A was in the path of Robot arm B in a sequence of welds once weld Robot A has sent the message to Robot B that it has moved out of its
  Path Robot B could continue its sequence and return to home position ready for the next sequence to begin. Communication consisted of a can bus system previously but lately
  has been updated to use cat5 and wireless protocols in low disturbance environments.
