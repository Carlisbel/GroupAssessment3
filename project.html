  <p align="justify">The team has decied over the 4 projects and have chosen Carl's project.  To create a Top Resume Builder Website that anybody can use to create
    a great professional grade product they can use
     to apply for a new job or career title. I haven't found another site which has an AU domain in the top 10 links found
      on google. Using Open source resources I plan to create and develop a “Professional Resume Builder website”.<br>
  </p>
  <p> We discussed all the Project Ideas as a group and have decided that the "Resume Builder Website" to be the best project to use as a team to setup.
    Everyone has different skill sets which can be utilized to get the website created for Assessment 3. I believe its a great task to show case our skills
  to our tutors, potential employers and investors in the future<br>
  Some items discussed during our meetings was a potential Name to call our resume builder website. The following ideas we have discussed "UltimateResume","PROresume4u",
  "UltimateResumeBuilder".<br>
  Planning to advertise this website using some social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, LinkedInn and toward Local Recruitment agencies, Students and Universites.
  A plan is in motion to Design and implement Website logo which can sit in the Favicon of a browser and an icon which can be used on 3rd Party websites as an entry into the
  "Resume Login Portal" or an icon that can be seen and clicked with touchscreen devices.

<br>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">The following are steps we will take for the initial setup of the "PROresume4u.com website":</h4>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>Registering the business name “PROresume4u” or "ITC OneSolution"</li><br>
  <li>Applying  for an ABN number and organising a business bank account at a local banking facility.</li><br>
  <li>Purchase of a Domain name. Occasionally a domain name is free for the first 12 months when a Online Hosting Service is subscribed too initially</li><br>
  <li>Hosting the Website on a “Homebased Webserver” using opensource Apache software on a windows-based computer.</li><br>
  <li>As some ISP providers may have clauses in the terms and conditions regarding running a webserver from home internet connection, I will consult with my NBN provider to check I am within these rules on their network prior to starting up the webserver software.</li><br>
  <li>An alternative solution to running a Home based webserver would to use an online hosting service wich has all the extra features you can utilise for a competitive price Hostgator.com</li><br>
  </ul>
    <br>
    <img src="hostgator.jpg" alt="hostgator.com" class="center" style="width:1000px;height:500px;"><br><br>
    
  <ul style="text-align: left;">  
  <li>Purchase of a dedicated PC to install the Apache webserver software on. This PC can be purchased as a used / second-hand unit to lower costs of start-up.A secondhand PC use is a resourceful way for a startup business to save money. Maintenance can be extremely expensive and involve getting new parts and having
 expensive servicing which can be unrealistic for a small business startup. Using a secondhand PC and buying smaller cost-effective moving parts that wear out first
 such as fans, hdds and power supplies that are readily available anywhere online. These kinds of secondhand resources can be found online on Facebook, Gumtree,
 Marketplace,ebay and at a computer swap market held monthly through out melbourne  etc. This means that we can spend money on other areas of the business. And of
 course utilizing secondhand parts still remains to be environmentally friendly over buying new.</li><br>
  <li>Customers initially on first sign up would enter their "username","email address", "create a password" for their account creation and to access the premium
    featured website. we have chosen a JavaScript user interface for user inputs. JavaScript forms are clean, neat, and easy for the user to navigate.
    User capabilities are very important to create a professional product.</li><br>
   </ul> <br><br>
    
  <img src="loginportal.jpg" alt="log in method" class="center" style="width:531px;height:257px;"><br><br>
   <img src="logindemocode.jpg" alt="logdemocode" class="center" style="width:500px;height:300px;"><br><br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>On our resume builder website our method will use is JavaScript and a Html Input form with multiple Input fields using (textarea element field) to capture the users
    data under the following Headings "Profile summary","Work Experience",Education", "Skills"and "References" and store this data into a database position.  By
    storing the data into the database the customers dont have to enter it all every time they want to edit their resume details.</li><br><br>
  </ul>
    <b>Demonstration of how a Javascript code may look like to enter details into a html template</b><br><br>
    
    <img src="sendingtemplate.jpg" alt="pouchdb flow chart" class="center" style="width:750px;height:750px;"><br><br>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>Using "pouchDB" as a database for Proresume4u domain name, PouchDB will work as a Client to an online CouchDB instance. Otherwise it will create a local
      database using whatever backend is present. PouchDb is not a self contained database; it is a CouchDB-style abstraction layer over other database layers.<br><br>
     </ul> 
    <b>This can be visualized below :</b><br><br>
      <img src="PouchDBflowchart.jpg" alt="pouchdb flow chart" class="center" style="width:750px;height:750px;"><br><br>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
    <li>PouchDB aims to provide a consistent API that "just works" across every browser and javascript environment, and in most cases the defaults are used. However,
      if your trying to reach a very large audience, or you want extreme performance, modification of the adapter settings will be required.
    </li><br>

  <li>This Data would be used to fill in a HTML Template of a resume design, also chosen by the user as their desired format. This would be stored in the database under the
    users details. Then be converted to a .doc word document file for download and email purposes.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <img src="resumetemplate.jpg" alt="resume template" class="center" style="width:700px;height:400px;"><br><br>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>We have identified the script google translate uses to translate our website into any Language the user requests for.</li><br>
  </ul>
    <img src="googletranslate.jpg" alt="google translate" class="center" style="width:700px;height:350px;"><br><br>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>The monthly Subscription fee still needs to be worked out as we don't have running costs and domain name fees its still in the early stages of development.
    But in saying that I wanted to keep it affordable so the general idea was to setup a low subscription fee of $2.75 AUD after converted to USD this works out
    to $1.99 USD approximately per subscription. So for example if were to get 100,000 subscriptions in the first 6-12 months the resume builder website would have
    generated a value of $275,000 Dollars in Australian Currency</li><br>
  <li>Setting a Long term <strong> "Goal to reach 1 million subscribers in the first 5 years online"</strong> is easily an achievable target provided we do the appropriate marketing and 
    advertising on social media reaching out to Recruitment companies, and possibly even leaving some carefully placed business cards on notice boards in high traffic zones. Provided everyone
    uses the website to create a single resume and cancels their subscription the very next day, the Total minimum revenue would reach $2.75 Million in five years or less.
    This puts the 1 year average annual income to $550,000. "This doesn't take into account how many people stay subscribed and how long for"</li><br>
    <li>To add onto this project some further depth I would really like to get it created to download off Google Play store and on the Itunes store, so both android
      and apple devices would run flawlessly. JavaScript runs in every web browser, out of the box. A JavaScript application runs on every device, whereas a desktop
      or mobile application runs only on the application it is targeted to (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, iPhone, Android). This allows you to write cross-platform apps
      in an easy method.</li><br>
  <li>For Subscription based customers there will be added features which enables the customers to produce custom cover letters to go with their PROresume with a limit
    of 5 different templates they can chose a specific layout which suits their Job type or title. And these can be stored in the data base for them to be edited at a
    later stage provided their subscription terms are met</li><br>
