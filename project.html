<h3 style="text-align:center"> <b>Hosting Service Information</b></h3>
<p>The home webserver option has now been quashed as it is a major security problem, I don’t want to be to blame for someone’s identity being stolen especially their credit card details and personal information I have now pursued a professional award-winning Hosting Service.
I have contacted a customer sales representative about purchasing the right product for my needs at HOSTGATOR.COM. I was informed my optimal choice would be to select the “Shared business hosting plan” for our group’s website.  JavaScript, html and css will work flawlessly.
However, I have also noted that the site will be limited to 7000 to 8000 visitors per day, after these numbers are met the speed of the connection slows down slightly as it is on a shared server. “Taking this into account means that we would need to reach more than 2.9 million visitors a year before we would need to migrate to a dedicated server model hosting service which would be closer to about $140USD a month”
The business Plan includes a free Positive SSL upgrade that secures a domain and a subdomain, is backed by a $10K USD warranty, and provides a trust Logo Site Seal to display on our website. Domain is provided for free initially in the first year.

<h3 style="text-align:center"> <b>What is affiliate Marketing?</b></h3>
<p>Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person’s or company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes
 that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another. <br>
The affiliate may get paid in various ways:

  </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Pay Per Sale</b> This is the standard affiliate marketing structure. In this program, the merchant pays the affiliate a percentage of the sale price of the product after the consumer purchases
 the product as a result of the affiliate’s marketing strategies. In other words, the affiliate must actually get the investor to invest in the product before they are compensated.    </li>
  <li><b>Pay per Lead</b>  A more complex system, pay per lead affiliate programs compensates the affiliate based on the conversion of leads. The affiliate must persuade the consumer to visit the merchant’s
 website and complete the desired action — whether it’s filling out a contact form, signing up for a trial of a product, subscribing to a newsletter, or downloading software or files.   </li>
  <li><b> Pay per Click</b> This program focuses on incentivizing the affiliate to redirect consumers from their marketing platform to the merchant’s website. This means the affiliate must engage the consumer
 to the extent that they will move from the affiliate’s site to the merchant’s site. The affiliate is paid based on the increase in web traffic.    </li>
